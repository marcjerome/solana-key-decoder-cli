# solana-key-decoder

**solana-key-decoder-cli** is a simple command-line tool for decoding Base58 encoded keys and saving them as JSON files. It takes a Base58 encoded key as input, decodes it, and saves the decoded key as a JSON array in a file named `key.json`.

## Installation

You can install solana-key-decoder-cli globally using npm:

``npm install -g solana-key-decoder-cli`` 

## Usage

After installation, you can use `solana-key-decoder-cli` from the command line as follows:

`solana-key-decoder-cli <key>` 

-   `<key>`: The Base58 encoded key that you want to decode and save as a JSON file.

For example:

`solana-key-decoder-cli BjLbhu2a8aAqB7cYqrFdq4357zdSxf7hbnQp5UVX4HdZEz6TyBzJk1kvJM` 

This will decode the provided key and save it as a JSON array in a file named `key.json` in the current working directory.
